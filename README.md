# Projects

Here's my journey in the form of code.
Throughout my introduction to coding at ALX I've worked on different aspects of Front-End Development and learned various technical skills and best practices using  Javascript, Vanilla HTML, Tailwind CSS and React.


I've reached the latter stages of the program and I'm now working on my Capstone Project which will be my first major project.The project has a timeline on five weeks. The first week was about designing the User Interface using Figma ,details can be found inside the projects README.md file of how I approached the design.
